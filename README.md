# COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker

This was another project of interest relevant to our times. The purpose behind this project was to hone my data interpretation skills with a strong focus on data visualizations using *only* tableau.  

## Data Used

The source of our data is taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The Economist Intelligence Unit's world-class forecasts are updated **every month** to incorporate the latest economic and political events. The latest data together with timely forecasts makes WorldData one of the *fastest* and most *reliable sources* of economic data.

This data runs from the beginning of January 2020, when the pandemic struck, until year ending 2022.
